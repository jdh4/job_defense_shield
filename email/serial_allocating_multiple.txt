<GREETING>

Below are <CASE> that ran on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITIONS>) in the past <DAYS> days:

<TABLE>

The CPU utilization (CPU-Util) of each job above is approximately equal to
100% divided by the number of allocated CPU-cores (100%/CPU-cores). This
suggests that you may be running a code that can only use 1 CPU-core. If this is
true then allocating more than 1 CPU-core is wasteful. A good target value for
CPU utilization is 90% and above.

Please consult the documentation of the software to see if it is parallelized.
For a general overview of parallel computing:

    https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/parallel-code

If the code cannot run in parallel then please use the following Slurm
directives:

    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1

You will experience shorter queue times by allocating only 1 CPU-core per job.
In some cases this will also allow you run more jobs simultaneously.

If you believe that the code is capable of using more than 1 CPU-core then
consider attending an in-person <a href="https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/help-sessions">Research Computing help session</a> for assistance.

You can check the CPU utilization of completed and actively running jobs by using
the "jobstats" command. For example:

<JOBSTATS>
